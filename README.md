Team Members: Cameron Brown (solo)
Required Installations: Python 3, matplotlib python addon, c++
Starter Code Used: MPL 2: Histogram

The program I created calculates statistics for a given data sample. This includes the mean, median, mode, standard
deviation, and variance. Additionally, graphs/charts can be displayed to better represent the data, specifically a line
graph, pie chart, histogram, Pareto chart, and a box-plot. This program uses both python and c++ to run, writing user
input acquired in c++ to a file, which a python script uses to perform the calculations and graph the data using
matplotlib.

Instructions:
- Open the terminal/command prompt.
- Navigate to the directory where the program's files are stored.
- (Windows) Enter "g++ main.cpp -o main.exe" to create the main.exe executable.
- (Linux/Mac) Enter "g++ -std=c++1y main.cpp"
- (Linux/Mac) Then enter "./a.out"
- Enter "main.exe" to run the executable
- Start by typing entering in each value of the data, enter "e" when done.
- The calculations should now be displayed, and you can enter a number to display a specific type of graph.
- The options shown are: "Line graph(1) Pie Chart(2) Histogram(3) Pareto Chart(4) Box-plot(5) End Program(e)""
- Enter "e" to terminate the program.
